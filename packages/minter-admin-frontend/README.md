# Admin & Minting pages for your dao.new made DAO

This package contains implementation of 2 pages useful for interacting with your NFT DAO clone.

1. `/admin` - admin page

   Used to manage your contracts, e.g enable minting, change mint price, release funds, etc. Only the creator of the NFT DAO can perform these operations.

2. `/` - minting page

   A page where users can mint tokens

These pages are meant as an example. Feel free to fork & extend.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo (or fork & clone)

   `$ git clone git@github.com:withtally/dao.new.git`

2. Install dependencies

   `$ cd dao.new`

   `$ yarn`

3. Update config file

   Open `packages/minter-admin-frontend/config.ts` for editing.

   3.1. Set `CHAIN_ID` to the chain you are working on (e.g `ChainId.Rinkeby` or `ChainId.Mainnet`)

   3.2. Update contracts address for the chain you are working on. You need to update `tokenAddress`, `minterAddress`, `governorAddress` & `timelockAddress`.

   3.3. Update `minterType` to the type of minter you have chosed. Options are: `MinterType.FixedPriceSequentialMinter` or `MinterType.FixedPriceSpecificIDMinter`

4. (Optional) Set RPC endpoints: create `packages/minter-admin-frontend/.env` file similar to the `.env.example` file in the same folder.
   The JSON RPC urls should look something like: `https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/dkgAjugSdf`. You can get an Alchemy api key by [signing up](https://www.alchemy.com/).

5. Run the webapp in development mode

   From the repo root folder run:

   ```
   $ yarn prebuild
   $ cd packages/minter-admin-frontend/
   $ yarn dev
   ```

6. Open browser at http://localhost:3000
